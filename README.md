# QHackathon25
A VQE simulation of CO₂ for Big Quantum Hackathon using real molecular integrals, demonstrating how variational quantum algorithms can support early studies in carbon-capture chemistry and showcase practical quantum methods for climate-focused research.

# VQE for Quantum Chemistry

A demonstration of using the **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)** to estimate molecular ground-state energies using **Hartree–Fock (HF)** initialization and the **UCCSD** ansatz.  
This project showcases how hybrid quantum-classical methods can simulate small molecules effectively.

## Overview
- Introduction to quantum chemistry  
- VQE formulation  
- HF initial-state construction  
- UCCSD ansatz  
- Example simulation (H₂)  

VQE uses parameterized quantum circuits and classical optimization to approximate the ground-state energy of a molecular Hamiltonian.

## Quantum Chemistry Basics
The electronic structure problem is defined by the Schrödinger equation:

$$
\hat{H}|\Psi\rangle = E|\Psi\rangle
$$

Under the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the Hamiltonian includes:
- electron kinetic energy  
- electron–nuclear attraction  
- electron–electron repulsion  
- nuclear–nuclear repulsion

## VQE Method
VQE minimizes the expectation value:

\[
E(\theta) = \langle \Psi(\theta) | \hat{H} | \Psi(\theta) \rangle
\]

A parameterized circuit prepares the trial state, and measurements guide a classical optimizer to update parameters.

## Hartree–Fock State
The HF reference wavefunction is:

\[
|\Psi_{HF}\rangle = \prod_{i=0}^{N-1} a_i^\dagger |0\rangle
\]

Mapped to qubits, this becomes applying **X-gates** to the initially occupied orbitals.

---

## UCCSD Ansatz
The UCCSD trial state is defined as:

\[
|\Psi\rangle = e^{(T - T^\dagger)} |\Psi_{HF}\rangle
\]

where \(T\) includes single and double excitations, mapped to qubit operators through standard fermion-to-qubit transformations.
